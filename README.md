# Reddit API with Redux
- This project is an example of data fetching with [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux). It's fully extrated from the [official documentation](http://redux.js.org/docs/advanced/ExampleRedditAPI.html).
- It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
- Besides, it uses the [Redux DevTools Extension](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension).

## Goal
I need to construct a basic API data fetching with Redux but, also, I need to use the new Create React App tool. Finally, the Redux Devtools Extension improve my development experience.
